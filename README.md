# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Pewlett-Hackard has requested information around the number of employees retiring in the near future.  The purpose of 
this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees eligible for the
mentorship program.  Pewlett-Hackard will use this information to determine if there are enough employees for 
the mentorship program to address the "silver tsunami" as current employees reach retirement age.

## Results 

The analysis generated 2 tables.  The first table shows the number of employees by title retiring in the near
future.
